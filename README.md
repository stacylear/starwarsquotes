Users can add a Star Wars quote to the database, Replace the first Yoda quote with a Darth Vader quote, or delete a Darth Vader quote.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-B4E582?logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E&style=flat&labelColor=454545"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Express-B4E582?logo=express&logoColor=F7DF1E&style=flat&labelColor=454545"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-MongoDB-B4E582?logo=mongodb&logoColor=F7DF1E&style=flat&labelColor=454545">

This simple web app demonstrates basic CRUD principles by combining JavaScript and Express with MongoDB. Two methods from MongoDB's Collections were used: findOneAndUpdate and deleteOne.

## Optimizations

Future optimizations could include sanitizing incoming quote data submitted by users, and expanding the options to allow replacement or deletion of other types of quotes. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project taught me the basics of choosing and installing node packages for the project, connecting to a MongoDB database, and the use of CRUD principles.
